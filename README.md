## My process

I originally started doing the project using Bootstrap, but decided to try doing this with just CSS so I could learn something new.

I started by getting the basic styles in place by giving elements classes and then applying fonts and colors.

I then researched how to do responsive layouts with CSS which brought me to Grid which kept referencing Flexbox so I started there.

I began with the desktop version and tinkered with various settings to get the layout looking like the mockup.  After that, I looked up how to change the layout for the mobile width and found media queries.  I then made the necessary adjustments for the mobile site.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was my first attempt at making a website without any tutorials or guidance.  It was also the first time I used CSS Grid and Flexbox.

I quickly learned that there is so much more to learn.

Grid and Flexbox are very powerful tools that made layout much easier (after a lot of trial and error). I also learned about mix-blend-mode and media queries which I hadn't known about.  Originally I used a color div with a lower opacity on z-2 to try and achieve the effect, but it was not quite right.  I took a peek at someone else's solution to see how they achieved the effect without making the image look washed out.

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning more about CSS layouts including Flexbox and Grid and what layouts each are best suited for.  I would like to learn more about CSS in general, as after this I feel like I have barely scratched the surface.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me to learn Flexbox which I initially tried to use for the entire project before realizing that grid was better at accomplishing what I needed to do.
- [Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids) - This explained Grid fairly well and I'm sure I will continue to use this as a reference going forward.
- [mix-blend-mode](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/mix-blend-mode/) - This article helped me to understand mix-blend-mode and what each value actually does.
